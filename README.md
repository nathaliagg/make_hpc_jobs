# HPC SLURM and PBS scrips

Collection of scripts to generate jobs in the HPC at University of Arizona. Ocelote - PBS, Puma - SLURM, and respective interactive jobs.

I have two different collections here: `cli` and `gui`. `cli` is the collection of scripts for command-line, and `gui` is the collection of scripts for graphical user interface. I used [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) to build the scripts in both collections, and in the `gui` collection I used [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) to transform the `cli` program into a GUI.
